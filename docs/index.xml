<h1>Velogames Spring Classics</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.velogames.com/">Velogames</a> website is another site for cycling fan and fantasy games lovers. The site has been <a href="https://www.velogames.com/about.php">up and running from 1997</a>, and that‚Äôs just simply amazing. Great job and congrats to its maintainer, George!</p>
<p>The competition offer is very rich nowadays. The <a href="https://www.velogames.com/sixes-superclasico/2023/">Six Superclasico</a> competiton is up all year long covering the classics, and your task is to pick the best 6 man team for every race, while the <a href="https://www.velogames.com/womens-classics/2023/">Women classics</a> is similar but focused on women professional cycling. You also have races for one-week and GT races belonging in the <a href="https://www.velogames.com/index_stage_season_2023.php">Stage Race Championships</a> category. I‚Äôll probably write another article about eternal regrets on those races too, but for today, let‚Äôs focus on the <a href="https://www.velogames.com/spring-classics/2023/">Velogames Spring Classics</a>! Note that I‚Äôm not the only geek interested in this problem. <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremader"><span class="citation" data-cites="jeremader">@jeremader</span></a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/CalumLonie"><span class="citation" data-cites="CalumLonie">@CalumLonie</span></a> have been posting regularly on Twitter provisional and best teams results. In fact, it is a post by <a href="https://twitter.com/CalumLonie"><span class="citation" data-cites="CalumLonie">@CalumLonie</span></a> last year that is behind my motivation to look deeper at this problem.</p>

<p>The Velogames Spring Classics is a unique competition. Depending on the year, up to 12 races are scheduled in this challenge. The goal is simple, build your team of 12 riders and maximize the number of points scored on all the 12 races. It is already hard enough, but the game becomes spicy if you add one more constraint: you have a limited number of transfers! You‚Äôll have to decide when you want to make a replacement, and who to keep even if they are not on the startlist for the race of the day. Let‚Äôs take a look at the best teams you could have done in 2021 and 2022.</p>

<p>Similarly to the previous post about <a href="https://papa-rapha.github.io/website/posts/03-2023-velogames-knapsack/">Rivals manager best team</a>, it is possible to formulate this question as a linear programming problem. Let‚Äôs start with a simplified problem. What would have been the best team possible without any replacement - i.e.&nbsp;if you had kept the same team from MSR (<em>Milano San remo</em>) to LBL (<em>Li√®ge-Bastogne-Li√®ge</em>). In that case, the problem can be formulated as follow:</p>
<p>Maximize the total number of points collected</p>

<p>In 2021, the best team without transfers would have scored 9374 points, and 11975 points in 2022. This means this strategy would have ranked 99th in 2021 and 26th in 2022. Not bad! Note that we have the same results than <a href="https://twitter.com/CalumLonie"><span class="citation" data-cites="CalumLonie">@CalumLonie</span></a>, it‚Äôs a relief!</p>
<p>It seems quite obvious that with transfers, we could do much better. But, by how much?</p>

<p>Our team must have exactly two riders, and we are allowed 2 transfers only. What is the best strategy to optimize score ? We can formulate our problem as follow:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmax%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E4%5Csum_%7Bj=1%7D%5E3%20x_%7Bi,j%7D%5Ccdot%5Cmathrm%7BPoints%7D_i%0A"></p>
<p>We want to maximize the sum of points obtained (by Riders A, B, .., D during races 1, 2, 3) with the constraints:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0As.t.%20&amp;%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E4%20x_%7Bi,%201%7D%20=%202%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E4%20x_%7Bi,%202%7D%20=%202%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E4%20x_%7Bi,%203%7D%20=%202%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D%0A"></p>
<p>meaning that for each race, we cannot have more than two riders in the team, and</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0As.t.%20&amp;%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E4%20x_%7Bi,%201%7D%5Ccdot%5Cmathrm%7BCost%7D_i%20%3C=%20100%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E4%20x_%7Bi,%202%7D%5Ccdot%5Cmathrm%7BCost%7D_i%20%3C=%20100%20%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E4%20x_%7Bi,%203%7D%5Ccdot%5Cmathrm%7BCost%7D_i%20%3C=%20100%20%20%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D%0A"></p>
<p>we must still respect the constaint over the cost of our team. Also,</p>

<section id="rivals-manager-introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Rivals manager: introduction</h1>
<p>I‚Äôve been playing at <a href="http://velo-club.com/general.php">Rivals manager</a> for a while. It‚Äôs a fantasy cycling game rolling all over the season. The principle is simple, you select a team of 30 to 35 riders before the beginning of the season, and they will score points riding and performing during the cycling road season, from January to October. There are a few constraints though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Riders all have a cotation. Cheaper riders cost 3 credits, while the most expensive riders cost around 35-38 credits depending on their performances during past seasons.</li>
<li>Your team has to have between 30 to 35 riders. You have to find a balance between expensive and already accomplished riders and young guns or lesser known riders who didn‚Äôt perform very well precedent years.</li>
<li>Your team cannot cost more than 225 credits. Although you can technically keep it much lower than that - you could take a team of 30 riders costing 3 each - it seems a good idea to aim for 225 credits and spend as much as you can.</li>
<li>There is a special category of riders called <em>Top Ligue</em> - <em>top league</em> in English. For the 2023 edition, 9 riders lie in this category: <a href="https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/tadej-pogacar">Tadej POGACAR</a>, <a href="https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/wout-van-aert/start">Wout VAN AERT</a>, <a href="https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/remco-evenepoel/start">Remco EVENEPOEL</a>, <a href="https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/primoz-roglic/start">Primoz ROGLIC</a>, <a href="https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/jonas-vingegaard-rasmussen/start">Jonas VINGEGAARD</a>, <a href="https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/julian-alaphilippe/start">Julian ALAPHILIPPE</a>, <a href="https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/mathieu-van-der-poel/start">Mathieu VAN DER POEL</a>, <a href="https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/jasper-philipsen/start">Jasper PHILIPSEN</a>, <a href="https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/aleksandr-vlasov/start">Aleksander VLASOV</a>. They are cycling superstars. You do not have to pick superstars necessarily, but at the same time, you cannot spend more than 63 credits in this category. This is the rule for the 2023 edition but the number of top league riders allowed or the cost constraint has changed from time to time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, riders will score points everytime they perform well in a race. The more prestigious the race, the more points riders can get. Similarly, more riders will be awarded points in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Tour_(cycling)">Grand Tour</a> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_monument">Monument</a> than in a continental race at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications">.1 level</a>.</p>
<p>Season 23‚Äô is well under way. Based on past years, can we have an idea of what has proven to be the best strategies - and by what margin the oracle would have won each season?</p>
</section>
<section id="knapsack-problem" class="level1">
<h1>Knapsack problem</h1>
<p>So, to summarize, our problem can be formulated as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a total number of credit of 225,</li>
<li>And a constraint on the number of team members which has to be between 30 to 35</li>
<li>With an extra constraint on the cost of the most expensive riders</li>
</ul>
<p>How can we maximize the number of points collected at the end of the year?</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not very familiar with classical optimization problems, but it turns out that this is exactly the formulation of a Knapsack problem. The original formulation goes as follow:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine which items to include in the collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Replace the collection by your squad, an item by a rider, the weight by the cotation of the rider, and the value by the total of points scored at the end of the season, and you almost got your Rivals‚Äô challenge! We‚Äôll have to add the two constraints over the ‚Äòtop league‚Äô riders and the fact that the total number of riders is constrained too.</p>
</section>
<section id="collecting-data" class="level1">
<h1>Collecting data</h1>
<p>Let‚Äôs begin by grabbing some data for our experiment. The rivals manager website is quite old and is not necessarily at the state of the art, and there is no API available to perform the request. So let‚Äôs do a little bit of web scrapping. We‚Äôll use <a href="https://rvest.tidyverse.org/">rvest</a> to do so. We‚Äôll also use <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr</a> and <a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/">tidyr</a> as utility packages for data handling, and <a href="https://purrr.tidyverse.org/">purrr</a> for functional oriented programming functions.</p>
<p>First function to read the riders‚Äô results.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs make sure we flag properly the ‚Äòtop league‚Äô for every year in the history. Sadly, it is hard to find valid info about who was in the top league in the past. I tried to collect all the information I could on the <a href="https://forum.velo-club.net/">forum</a>, but it‚Äôs not easy to find. I think I managed to find every member of the top league, but couldn‚Äôt find the maximum cost for top league riders you were able to pick for years 2013, and 2015 to 2019. There was no constraint at all in 2020. Since it seems the cotation strategy was the same for the 2013-2019 period, I‚Äôll make the hypothesis that the limit for top league riders was identical to the one for the year 2014, i.e.&nbsp;93.</p>

<p>We can observe several changes in the performance scores. Several phenomenom are at stake here. Firstly, rules have changed in the way the game was played. There were more riders in the top league category and even if the budget allowed was more important, it had an impact on the way teams were made. Secondly, 2020 was different because of covid. Thirdly, some riders have become easily predictable lastly, whith Tadej Pogacar or Wout Van Aert (and a few others) being extremly dominant. It doesn‚Äôt mean that they will necessarily be in the top teams, but they are somehow safe picks as they will win a lot of rewarding races all year long.</p>

<h1>Best team: Oracle</h1>
<p>Now, let‚Äôs try to find what could have been the best team, the one we would have chosen if we were an oracle. One way to solve this problem is by using linear programming. The idea is to represent the problem as a value to be maximized while respecting the different constraints. One way to do it in R is to use the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lpSolve/index.html">lpSolve package</a> which is an interface to the free and open source solver <a href="https://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/">lpSolve</a>.</p>
<p>We can now specify our LP problem. We want to maximize the value of our team, i.e:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmax%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5EN%20x_i%5Ccdot%5Cmathrm%7BPoints%7D_i%0A"></p>
<p>where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N"> is the number of riders in the game, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_i"> a binary variable (1 or 0) wether rider <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> is included in the team or not, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathrm%7BPoints%7D_i"> the total of points for rider <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> at the end of the season. We have to respect the following contraints :</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0As.t.%20%5Csum_i%20x_i%20%5Cleq%2035%0A"></p>
<p>the team must not exceed 35 riders, and</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Csum_i%20x_i%20%5Cgeq%2030%0A"></p>
<p>must at least have 30 riders at minimum, and</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Csum_i%20x_i%5Ccdot%5Cmathrm%7BCost%7D_i%20%5Cleq%20225%0A"></p>
<p>the total cost must not exceed 225, and</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Csum_i%20x_i%5Ccdot%5Cmathrm%7BTopLeague%7D_i%5Ccdot%5Cmathrm%7BCost%7D_i%20%5Cleq%20%5Cmathrm%7BMaxTopLeague%7D%0A"></p>
<p>the ‚Äòtop league‚Äô cost must not exceed a max value which changes every year. In the above equations, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Cost_i"> is the cost of the rider <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?TopLeague_i"> indicates if the rider <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> is in the top league category and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathrm%7BMaxTopLeague%7D"> is a constant value for every year.</p>
<p>Now, we can specify our LP problem. Let‚Äôs solve the problem for the whole period now. Let‚Äôs build a <code>maximize_score</code> function to easily compute the scores for each year.</p>

<p>Whoever plays that kind of game is always full of regrets. Why didn‚Äôt I pick this rider instead of this one? Why did I trust him, again? The good news is, there are a lot of possible teams better than the best human player, so hope is still there for you!</p>

  <title>Welcome To My Blog ! ‚ÄòR avanc√© & introduction √† Git‚Äô</title>
  <dc:creator>Rapha√´l</dc:creator>
  <link>https://papa-rapha.github.io/website/posts/welcome/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This is the first post of this blog. Welcome !</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been pleased to teach a R course at the university of Nantes this winter untitled ‚ÄòR avanc√© &amp; introduction √† Git‚Äô. You will be able to find the course materials <a href="https://rnedellec-r-advanced-git.netlify.app/">there</a>. The lesson is in French. It was a good exercise to build the materials from scratch, with the help of the awesome resources from posit team, such as <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/">R advanced</a> or <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/">R packages</a>. I got heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.andrewheiss.com/teaching/">Andrew Heiss</a> teaching material to organize the class content online. Hopefully, I‚Äôll have time to improve and personalize the styling for next year.</p>
<p>The final report goal was to build a personal blogging website, using CI-CD, github and reproducible science tools from the R environment to write articles efficiently. I had to do it myself, so here I am.</p>
