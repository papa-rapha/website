I’m about to join a new company and start a new position. Stay tuned.\nI also enjoy teaching when I can. I did teach in the past at Ensai, CEPE, Dauphine University, Nantes Université."

    "text": "This is the first post of this blog. Welcome !\nI’ve been pleased to teach a R course at the university of Nantes this winter untitled ‘R avancé & introduction à Git’. You will be able to find the course materials there. The lesson is in French. It was a good exercise to build the materials from scratch, with the help of the awesome resources from posit team, such as R advanced or R packages. I got heavily inspired by Andrew Heiss teaching material to organize the class content online. Hopefully, I’ll have time to improve and personalize the styling for next year.\nThe final report goal was to build a personal blogging website, using CI-CD, github and reproducible science tools from the R environment to write articles efficiently. I had to do it myself, so here I am."
